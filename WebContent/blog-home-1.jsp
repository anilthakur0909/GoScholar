                    <center><p class="b1"> <b><font size="04">Being always prepared for the opportunity is the key to success and what it takes to grab an opportunity is <br>Preparation, Readiness and Determination.<br> Don’t let the failure stop you. Failure is just perfectly normal. One who never failed in one’s life has never tried something new.</font></b></p></center>

                    <font size="4"  color="black" text="left" align="justify" >  <p class="sansserif"> There is a saying “success is where the preparation meets the opportunity “. Now allow me to decode it that means you could prepare all you want and put all your best efforts but if you don't have the opportunity it is a wasted effort.  Let me take you to the story of opportunities within my life .When I was in class 7th, I had a chance to play for my school football team. At that time I thought it’s a great opportunity and I could certainly do something good in this sport. I played for two years but then I quit playing this game for some reasons. My passion for football just died out like a plant that is not taken care of. After 2-3 years I got the chance to play badminton for my school team. I had dreams in my eyes and I set myself with a goal but within a year the fire in my belly for the game just died out. It’s funny but when I chose commerce as my subjects, I thought this is something great and I'm born for this thing. But After my 12th I dropped an year and decided to do what I always wanted to do. I had passion for literature, so I took admission in the B.A. hons in English and felt content as the fire in me was still alive and later pursued Masters in English literature.</p> 
					 <p class="sansserif">So what you could make out of my little life story where I had or I suppose I had ample of opportunities but I just couldn't stick to any till I was not determined and guided enough. So what I want to convey to you guys is that life is full of opportunities you will have new opportunities on every single day but these opportunities means nothing if you are not prepare to take them with open arms. What it takes to grab an opportunity is Preparation, Readiness and Determination.One who never failed in one’s life has never tried something new</p>
					 <p class="sansserif"> SCHOLAR’S main motive is to prepare you guys for the coming opportunities so that you don't have to kill two or three opportunities before grabbing the One. As this article might look like an advertisement but believe me it’s not. </p>
					 <center><p class="b1"> <b><font size="04">There is a Spanish saying that opportunity is like a bald woman it means it might look ugly on its face</p>                     
						<p class="sansserif">The sole purpose of<a href="index.jsp"> SCHOLAR </a>is to pave the way for the youngsters and make you guys better equipped to fight your battle in this competitive world.</p>
