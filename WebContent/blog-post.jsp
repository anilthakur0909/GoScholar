					Education Policies</b></font>

			<p class="sansserif">Indian University system dates back to 1857
				started by Britishers. The first three universities founded were
				university of Madras, Calcutta and Bombay. IIT’s dates back to
				1956 and NIT’s to 1959(formerly known as Regional Engineering
				Colleges). From there technical education in India bolstered
				technological developments that are present in India now. But World
				is drastically ever changing and India has to keep a pace with that
				by proactively scrutinizing education policies and systems. In fact
				no IIT is amongst top 200 institutes. (Top most being IIT Bombay
				#202, as per QS world university rankings 2015.) Though in April
				early this year UGC came up with CBCS (choice based credit system
				(cbcs) to remove policy paralysis, but it’s in huge controversy
				too.</p>

		</p>
		<font size="4" color="black" text="left" align="justify">
			<p class="sansserif">The reason number fake degree scams are
				erupting is obsession with degrees. In India a graduate or a post
				graduate degree is seen as more of a status than the educational
				benefits of the same. A degree is also seen as a key to land in a
				job rather than learning and developing an expertise on a particular
				subject. So a considerable number of people just study for the sake
				of degrees not for knowledge. Which provides a pathway for private
				players [Universities and Colleges] to cash in this psychology. This
				also deteriorates the learning capability and overall development</p>

			<font size="06" color="black"><b>4.Student Culture</b></font>
		</p>
		<font size="4" color="black" text="left" align="justify">
			<p class="sansserif">With the lapses in bureaucratic structure of
				Indian education system the negative student culture even worsen the
				situation Today India is more social and connected than it ever was.
				Social media is main element of that connectivity and is mostly
				driven by people of age group (17-35). Mostly graduates and working
				Millennials come under this category. But students in degree
				colleges are more obsessed with it. The Picture of "YOUTH" that is
				currently being painted by media is misleading in many ways. It
				shows more of a casual,fun and fashion side of youth rather than the
				darker side of student aspirations that got buried every year on
				repeat. Severe online presence develops a sense of inferiority and
				casualness which ultimately affects studies and professional growth.
				Also peer pressure is a vital fact in shaping your attitudes. So
				choose your group wisely. (It’s not like you have to be mean, but
				keep your professional goals at frontline)</p>

					Better Education and Career</b></font>
		</p>

		<font size="4" color="black" text="left" align="justify">
			<p class="sansserif">In India If you are in IIT or NIT you are
				excellent and considered employable otherwise waste of oxygen.
				Earlier IIT-JEE and AIEEE were only two exams to get education from
				IIT’s and NIT’s. Now it’s JEE (Mains and Advanced) Some
				students perform well in these exams and shape their future to get a
				job at a MNC and some couldn’t. Those who left are forced to join
				private universities which rake in higher fees and provide very less
				job opportunities or placements. Also there is a Stigma in MNC’s
				to hire from only topmost colleges. Talent can be present in tier 3
				colleges also. So students from these colleges with higher marks and
				talent don’t even get a chance to join MNC and are forced to live
				a life of Mediocrity despite being equally talented and academically
				strong.</p>
